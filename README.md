# sap-vpn-ms

This is a modified version of the sap-vpn script provided on NimbusServer that adds a "status" capability to check if the VPNB is already started.
Syntax (started): $ sap-vpn status
                  Status of VPN...
                    VPN is started.
Syntax (stopped): $ sap-vpn status
                  Status of VPN...
                    VPN is stopped.
